# Passenger Survival Analysis - Decision Tree Classifier

This project presents a simple machine learning model built for educational purposes. It uses a Decision Tree Classifier to analyze passenger data and determine which features were most relevant to predicting survival.

The main goal is to practice working with key Python libraries for data science and machine learning, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

## Project Objectives

- Practice implementing a classification model using scikit-learn.
- Explore which passenger features were most indicative of survival.
- Visualize the decision-making process of a decision tree.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- numpy: Numerical operations
- matplotlib: Data visualization
- seaborn: Statistical plotting
- scikit-learn: Model building and evaluation

## Model Description

This project uses the `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `scikit-learn`, a simple and interpretable machine learning algorithm suitable for binary classification tasks.

Features used in the model include:

- Class (Passenger Class)
- Gender
- Age
- Horizontal ties
- Vertical ties

The model is trained to classify survival outcomes and provides insights into the importance of different features.

## Outputs and Visualizations

The project includes the following visual outputs:

- A bar plot showing feature importances
- A decision tree plot illustrating how predictions are made
- A confusion matrix displaying model performance
